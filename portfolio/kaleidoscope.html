      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The challenge:</b>
        Qwilr's platform / product was ~5 years old when I joined the company, and there were various inconsistencies in
        the product that were deteriorating the user experience, and a gap in communication between design and
        engineering which was costing time and effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>My role:</b>
        I was brought on to help bridge the gap between design and engineering, and establish a design system (named
        "Kaleidoscope") which would then be the source of truth and communally maintained.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Discovery: Research and audit</h4>
            I started off by researching other design systems and reading about various models and methods for establishing one. For Qwilr, we started by conducting an interface audit, which took stock of the components used across different areas of the app, involved others in the company, and provided a tangible focus point.  
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Establishing a shared language</h4>
            Next, we met with various stakeholders to decide how to name and organise the components and guides which the design system would contain, so there would be a shared "language" across design and engineering.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Influencing engineering process</h4>
            Previously, efforts to systematise Qwilr's design would influence design process, but weren't sustainable for engineers. I interviewed several engineers about their process, and created a standalone repository to hold code components for the design system, which was then used as a submodule in the main app repo. This ended up being the most suitable solution for the company at the time and for the next stage of engineering. Engineers had also already started using Storybook, but after this work we started relying on it to build components first and tighten the feedback loop between design and engineering.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Creating a hub</h4>
            We then created a website for Kaleidoscope, to host the guide, components, and stable storybook instance as a source of truth for the whole company. I created the initial version of the Kaleidoscope website, which is now maintained by many people across the company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Ongoing work</h4>
            Design systems are living things, and require constant maintenance. During the rest of my time at Qwilr, I worked on systematising efforts such as unifying icons, and contributing to creating and reviewing components for the system. But Kaleidoscope is now integrated into the product process at Qwilr, and the responsibility of maintaining is distributed such that it continues to evolve now that I've left the company.
