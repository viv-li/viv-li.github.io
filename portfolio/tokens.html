			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				Qwilr gives everyone the power to create beautiful web documents. For enterprise users with CRM (Hubspot and Salesforce) integrations, using templates with "tokens" allows them to use these customisable templates within their existing CRM workflow.
			</p>
				The feature had initially been designed by someone without enough technical knowledge to understand users' CRM workflows and needs, and it was very difficult for users to understand and create templates with "tokens".
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to my technical background as a software engineer, I was brought on as the product designer to redesign this feature. Here's an overview of my changing role through the different phases of the project.
			</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>Discovery</h4>
						As this project was a redesign, I started by interviewing all of the stakeholders in the previous project who were still present at the company to understand the challenges and constraints they faced. I interviewed customers and gathered written feedback to discover their previous and current pain points.</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Design</h4>
						The largest problem faced by the last project and this one was a technical one of being able to query Salesforce to provide the correct "tokens". I collaborated with software engineers to find solutions which balanced technical and design side solutions to this problem. I led various rounds of brainstorming, and then iterated by creating designs and click-through prototypes in Figma.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Prototyping</h4>
						Next, I prototyped the riskiest (most novel / costly to build) parts of the design in code, and used these prototypes to validate ideas before they were built into the product by engineers. These prototypes were testing with non-customer users via unguided tests conducted online, and shown to existing customers for feedback.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Building</h4>
						I "sliced" the design work into different parts for engineers to build, and continued to collaborate and tweak designs as well as conduct design reviews throughout the build and launch phases of the project, which were done in three different parts ("slices"). 
					</li>
				</ol>
